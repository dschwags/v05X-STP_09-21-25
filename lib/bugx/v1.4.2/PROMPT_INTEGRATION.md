# AI-to-User Prompt Integration Guide

## üö® Why We Need Proactive Prompts

**The 11:19 Problem:** We jumped straight into complex state management without warning you about the risks. Result: 400+ syntax errors and 82+ wasted credits.

**The Solution:** AI should ask permission before risky implementations, not apologize after disasters.

---

## üéØ Key Prompt Triggers

### 1. **STATE MANAGEMENT COMPLEXITY** (Most Critical)

**Trigger When:**
```typescript
// AI detects these patterns in user requests:
- "conditional logic" + "React components"
- "role-based" + "show/hide fields" 
- "dropdown dependencies"
- "dynamic form fields"
```

**Prompt Example:**
```
üö® STATE MANAGEMENT COMPLEXITY DETECTED

I'm about to implement conditional logic requiring:
‚Ä¢ React useState for tracking selections  
‚Ä¢ Multiple event handlers
‚Ä¢ Conditional JSX rendering

This is where we got 400+ syntax errors last time.

Options:
A) Full Planning First (+8 credits, high success)
B) Basic Implementation (+5 credits, medium risk)
C) Rush Implementation (-2 credits, HIGH RISK)

Your choice?
```

**Why This Matters:** State management is the #1 source of React syntax cascades.

---

### 2. **CREDIT BUDGET WARNING** (Financial Protection)

**Trigger When:**
```typescript
creditBalance < 50 AND taskComplexity === 'complex'
```

**Prompt Example:**  
```
‚ö†Ô∏è CREDIT BUDGET WARNING

You're at 35 credits, I'm about to attempt complex implementation.

Risk: 25-40 credits to implement + 20-50 credits if errors occur
Safe option: Basic version now (10 credits), advanced features later

Proceed with full implementation or play it safe?
```

**Why This Matters:** Prevents you from going into credit debt on risky implementations.

---

### 3. **SYNTAX CASCADE PREVENTION** (Error Recovery)

**Trigger When:**
```typescript
errorCount > 20 // Before it becomes 400+
```

**Prompt Example:**
```
üõë SYNTAX CASCADE DETECTED  

Current: 23 TypeScript errors
This is exactly what led to 400+ errors at 11:19 timestamp.

Options:
A) STOP and rollback to working state (+3 credits)
B) Fix incrementally (+8 credits, medium risk)
C) Push through (VERY HIGH RISK - this is what failed before)

History shows option C wastes 50+ credits. Your choice?
```

**Why This Matters:** Catches error cascades early before they become disasters.

---

## üîß Other Beneficial Prompt Areas

### 4. **DATABASE SCHEMA CHANGES**

**Trigger:** Database schema modifications + new feature implementation

**Risk:** Breaking existing functionality, migration issues

**Prompt:**
```
üóÑÔ∏è DATABASE COMPLEXITY DETECTED

Modifying schemas + implementing new features simultaneously.

A) Schema first, test, then features (+10 credits, safe)
B) Parallel development (+7 credits, medium risk)  
C) Features first, schema later (+5 credits, integration risk)
```

### 5. **THIRD-PARTY INTEGRATIONS** 

**Trigger:** External API/service integration detected

**Risk:** Network failures, authentication issues, service unavailability

**Prompt:**
```
üîå THIRD-PARTY INTEGRATION DETECTED

A) Full fallback strategy (+12 credits, robust)
B) Basic integration (+7 credits, standard)
C) Simple connection (+4 credits, assumes services work)
```

### 6. **TECHNICAL DEBT ACCUMULATION**

**Trigger:** Multiple TODO comments, temporary fixes detected

**Risk:** Codebase becomes unmaintainable

**Prompt:**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è TECHNICAL DEBT WARNING

Multiple temporary fixes detected.

A) Clean up first (+8 credits, solid foundation)
B) Fix as we go (+3 credits, manageable)
C) Ignore for now (0 credits, increasing debt)
```

## üöÄ Implementation Pattern for AI

### When to Show Prompts:

```typescript
// BEFORE starting implementation
if (detectsComplexity(userRequest)) {
  const prompts = evaluatePromptTriggers({
    taskType: userRequest,
    complexity: analyzeComplexity(userRequest),
    creditBalance: getCurrentCredits(),
    errorCount: getCurrentErrors(),
    codebaseSize: getCodebaseMetrics(),
    hasExistingDebt: checkTechnicalDebt()
  });
  
  // Show prompts and wait for user choice BEFORE proceeding
  await showPromptsToUser(prompts);
}

// THEN implement based on user's informed choice
```

### Prompt Timing:
- ‚úÖ **BEFORE** risky implementations
- ‚úÖ **WHEN** error thresholds are reached  
- ‚úÖ **IF** credit budgets are low
- ‚ùå **NOT** after problems already occurred

## üéØ Financial Goals Phase Application

### Expected Prompt Scenario:
```
User: "Now implement the financial goals with conditional logic based on user roles"

AI: üö® STATE MANAGEMENT COMPLEXITY DETECTED
     This requires conditional logic similar to what caused 400+ errors.
     
     A) Full Planning First (+8 credits, high success rate)
     B) Basic Implementation (+5 credits, medium risk)  
     C) Rush Implementation (-2 credits, HIGH RISK)
     
     Based on our 11:19 experience, I recommend Option A. Your choice?

User: A

AI: Perfect! I'll plan the state management first, then implement incrementally 
    with validation at each step. This should prevent the syntax cascade we 
    encountered before.
```

## üí° Prompt Benefits

### Credit Savings:
- **Prevents 50+ credit error cascades**
- **Gives user control over credit spending**  
- **Enables informed risk decisions**

### Quality Improvements:
- **Forces planning before implementation**
- **Catches problems early**
- **Builds user confidence in AI decisions**

### Learning Value:
- **Teaches user about implementation risks**
- **Explains why certain approaches are safer**
- **Builds shared understanding of complexity**

## üîë Key Principle

**AI should be a collaborative partner, not a black box.**

Instead of:
```
AI: "I'll implement conditional logic now..." 
[400+ errors later]
AI: "Sorry, that didn't work..."
```

Better:
```
AI: "I'm about to implement conditional logic. This is risky based on our 
     previous experience. Here are your options with honest credit estimates..."
User: Makes informed choice
AI: Implements according to user's risk tolerance
```

**The user should always know what they're getting into BEFORE the credits are spent.**
