## Executive Summary

This modernization project transforms the Scholarship Tracker Pro application through fresh architecture rebuild while preserving all existing UX/design elements, conditional logic, and functionality. The project integrates BugX methodology by default and targets institutional licensing with family validation approach.

**Key Objectives:**
- Fresh build eliminating legacy technical debt
- BugX methodology integration preventing expensive debugging cycles
- Institutional licensing business model (B2B2C)
- Family testing validation before institutional sales
- Comprehensive dynamic logic and conditional testing framework

**Success Metric:** Students use voluntarily without parental prompting
