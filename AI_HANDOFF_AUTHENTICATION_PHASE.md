## üéØ PHASE 2 OBJECTIVES

### PRIMARY GOAL: User Registration & Authentication System

### üèóÔ∏è TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS
1. **NextAuth.js v5 Implementation**
   - Credentials provider for email/password
   - Session management with proper typing
   - Role-based access control (student/parent/counselor)

2. **Dynamic Registration Forms**
   - Role selection (Student/Parent/Counselor)
   - Conditional fields based on role
   - Educational level validation
   - Institution domain validation (for licensing)

3. **User Dashboard Foundation**
   - Replace current placeholder dashboard
   - Role-specific landing areas
   - Navigation structure for authenticated users

4. **Database Integration**
   - User creation and management
   - Proper relationship setup (parent/student connections)
   - Institution association for licensing

### üé® UI/UX REQUIREMENTS
- **Consistent with landing page** styling and dark mode support
- **Progressive disclosure** - show fields based on previous selections
- **Space optimization** - forms must be compact yet comprehensive
- **Mobile responsive** - works on all device sizes

### üîí SECURITY REQUIREMENTS
- **Password validation** - minimum complexity requirements
- **Email verification** flow
- **Role permission system** - parents can access student data, counselors have institutional access
- **Institution domain validation** - for B2B2C licensing model

## üìã IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST

### Phase 2A: Authentication Infrastructure (Week 1)
- [ ] Install and configure NextAuth.js v5
- [ ] Create authentication providers and callbacks
- [ ] Implement session management system
- [ ] Add proper TypeScript types for sessions
- [ ] Create middleware for protected routes

### Phase 2B: Registration System (Week 1-2)
- [ ] Build dynamic registration form component
- [ ] Implement role selection logic
- [ ] Add conditional field rendering
- [ ] Create form validation schemas (Zod)
- [ ] Integrate with database user creation

### Phase 2C: User Dashboard (Week 2)
- [ ] Replace placeholder dashboard in `app/page.tsx`
- [ ] Create role-specific dashboard layouts
- [ ] Add user profile management
- [ ] Implement navigation structure
- [ ] Connect to existing header component

### Phase 2D: Testing & Polish (Week 2-3)
- [ ] Test all registration flows
- [ ] Verify role permissions work correctly
- [ ] Test parent/student relationship creation
- [ ] Ensure mobile responsiveness
- [ ] BugX validation and error handling

---

## üõ†Ô∏è TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS

### Database Schema Extensions Needed
```typescript
// User table already exists in lib/db/schema.ts
// May need additional fields for:
- institutionId (for licensing)
- parentId (for student/parent relationships)
- emailVerified (for verification flow)
- role permissions (JSON field)
```

### Required Dependencies
```json
{
  "next-auth": "5.0.0-beta.4",
  "@auth/drizzle-adapter": "latest",
  "zod": "^3.22.4",
  "@hookform/resolvers": "^3.3.2",
  "react-hook-form": "^7.47.0"
}
```

### Environment Variables Needed
```
AUTH_SECRET=           # Already configured in Vercel
AUTH_TRUST_HOST=true   # For Vercel deployment
```

## üéØ SUCCESS CRITERIA

### Technical Success
- [ ] Users can register with email/password
- [ ] Role-based registration works (student/parent/counselor)
- [ ] Authentication persists across page reloads
- [ ] Protected routes redirect unauthenticated users to landing page
- [ ] Dashboard displays appropriate content for each role

### UX Success
- [ ] Registration flow feels intuitive and quick
- [ ] Forms adapt dynamically to user selections
- [ ] Error messages are clear and actionable
- [ ] Mobile experience is seamless

## üöÄ GETTING STARTED PROTOCOL

1. **Read Current State**: Use `file_tree` and `read_file` to understand existing structure
2. **Review Schema**: Check `lib/db/schema.ts` for current User table structure
3. **Plan Extensions**: Identify what needs to be added vs modified
4. **Batch Implementation**: Use credit-efficient approach with grouped operations
5. **Test Incrementally**: Verify each component works before moving to next

### First Actions Recommended
1. Install NextAuth.js v5 dependencies
2. Create basic authentication configuration
3. Test sign-in/sign-up flow with existing UI
4. Extend registration form with role selection
5. Build basic dashboard structure

## üîó REFERENCE ARCHITECTURE

**Business Model**: B2B2C Institutional Licensing
- Students register individually or through institution domains
- Parents can create accounts linked to students
- Counselors have institutional access to student portfolios
- Institutions can customize branding and features

**Success Metric**: "Students use voluntarily without parental prompting"
- Registration must be smooth and compelling
- Dashboard must provide immediate value
- Progressive disclosure prevents overwhelming new users

---

## ‚ö° BugX v1.4.1 EFFICIENCY PROTOCOLS

- **Smart Tool Selection**: Use `selectOptimalTool()` to choose write_file vs search_replace_batch
- **Batch Operations**: Group related changes using `planBatchOperations()`
- **Selective Verification**: Use `shouldSkipVerification()` to skip low-risk checks
- **Response Optimization**: Concise explanations focused on essentials
- **Credit Monitoring**: Target 5-15 credits per task, max 25 credits
- **Reference**: All protocols defined in `lib/bugx/v1.4.1/index.ts`
